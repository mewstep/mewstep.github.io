look man. im not a blogger. but i do want a website, and this is the easiest one to set up (that doesnt look like total garbage, anyway)

at one point i saw my future as being a web designer, but luckily i got over that after realising i could do literally anything eles. this leaves me in an awkward middle place between not knowing a thing about web design, and knowing just enough to be annoyed by everything.

why is it that there are no **visual** static web designers for free? Like, why can I not just drag and drop graphics and shit onto a canvas? why am I having to write css files? (note: i know all of this is possible, I just don't want to pay money - AND, these tools are usually designed for like, proper website use. I don't want to make a store! I just want to host pretty pictures!)

Anyway, eventually you'll find me hosting my art on here somehow. That's the plan, anyhow. I'm already on places like Artstation, but I wanna just be able to give someone a link that belongs to me, that goes to a place that belongs to me, etc. You get me? Linking to a social feels unstable.
