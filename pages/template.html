<div id=innercontent>
<link rel="stylesheet" href="/styles/style.css">
<h1 id="pagetitle">content 1</h1>
<p>basically the site loads the contents of different .html files into a frame. this is to save me having to have a bunch of html pages with the same stuff in them, that are super hard to edit later on. doing it this way, I can change the layout of the site whenever I want and its basically no big deal. :3</p>
<p>heres how it does it:</p>
<img src="/media/contentswitchexample.png"/>
</div>
