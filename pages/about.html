<p>hi hello i am kat and i am a weird little animal who draws pictures & makes stuff</p>
<h2>what is the purpose of this website</h2>
<p>like many of the people who use neocities, i too do not like the direction the internet is heading in. i want to have my own space online.</p>
<p>as well, I have always had a passing interest in web development, so I would like a space to experiment.</p>
