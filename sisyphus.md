In the brains of neurotypical people, reward chemicals are created upon the completion of tasks. For people with executive dysfunctions like ADHD, this is not the case - instead, tasks are painful, tedious and boring. In the neurotypical, this reward system creates well-worn pathways in the brain, over time they learn to associate completing tasks with feeling good, making them want to continue. In dysfunctional people this is the opposite. Because tasks are painful they begin avoiding tasks to avoid the pain. This avoidant behaviour atrophies the good pathways, and reinforces the bad. As a result, they become stuck in cycles of avoidant behaviour.

There are a number of ways I have found to get around this, and I try to implement each of them equally.

Number one: you can supplement part of that reward system manually. Break down large tasks into smaller, much simpler steps. Then after each step give yourself a reward: be that a sweet treat, lying down with some music, watching a short youtube video, scrolling on social media -- so long as it's something you enjoy. It is important for this treat to be limited, so you are left wanting more. Then, get back to work. Rinse and repeat. This will feel terrible at first - think of your brain as a petulant child, throwing a tantrum because its toys were taken away -- try to keep moving, it's worth it.

Over time, your brain will begin to associate tasks with these treats, much like a neurotypical's brain, and similar pathways will start to form. From there, keeping them maintained is alot simpler.

Number two: do your best to push through the boredom. If you have implemented the first step and that good pathway is starting to form, you should do your best to also erode the pathways caused by avoidant behaviour. Every time you do a task, push a little further through the stage where you start to get bored and frustrated -- but you have to be careful, and patient. This is a glacial progress. You should not push yourself too hard, because you WILL burn out, and it can make your avoidance much worse.

Every time you push through this boredom, you are taking pieces of that negative pathway and moving them to the positive, and over long enough you will eventually become more functional.

During this whole process it is important to be kind to yourself. It sounds silly, but even doing as little as substituting harsh language toward yourself can do a lot. Instead of thinking of yourself as stupid, lazy, focus on the positives: you're moving! Everything you do that isn't avoidant moves you closer to being able to function. Everything. Every little step is as important as the last. You are smart and capable, you just need to push yourself harder than most people. It isn't fair, but its the hand you have been dealt.

I do not consider any mental illness a superpower, and I think alot of the support that tries to twist your diagnosis into one is dishonest and harmful, and to be honest, insulting. That being said, these practices are useful to employ for anybody, even those with "normal" brains. You can consider your learning and employing of these practices as a sort of superpower, with their continued use possibly even pushing you beyond the average person. I'm not there yet and so I can't argue that this is possible, but I can hope.

One thing that helps me do this is thinking of my subconscious as a separate entity. If you are mean to it, it'll start to dislike you and rebel against you. But if you are kind to it, nourish it with what it needs, it will grow to trust you, and to work with you. Like a scared animal.

Your subconscious doesn't have an easy way of communicating with your conscious brain, so it's hard to discern what it needs. I think that over time as you are kinder to it you can start to work out its patterns.

Because you most likely have been dealing with dysfunction for a long time, getting started on dealing with it can be difficult, or even feel impossible. Consider yourself like Sisyphus pushing his boulder up the hill: your muscles are atrophied from misuse, and trying to push this heavy boulder on your own is likely to just injure you, push your muscles further into atrophy. Instead, don't try to rush forward, take a step back and think about it. Use something as leverage just to get that boulder moving the *smallest* amount. Once its moving, its inertia should allow you to keep it moving until you can't anymore. Then, let it fall. Take a break.

As you repeat this each day, your muscles begin to repair themselves, and each day you can push the boulder *slightly* further. Eventually, with continued patience and persistence, your muscles are back and stronger than ever. You can push the boulder as far as you want.

Lets stop this analogy and talk practically. Getting back to functionality after a long time away from it is impossible if you just rush into it. You can see this when you have likely tried to get back into things you used to enjoy but end up getting tired and frustrated, getting nothing done.

Instead, you need to ease yourself into it. What works will be different for everybody, but I will give some examples. I am an artist, so I need to keep myself creative. Instead of rushing right into doing a piece, I will start with a simple, mindless creative task first.

This usually involves some sort of outside influence, like rolling some dice or letting a friend tell me what to draw, or simply allowing my hands to move without any conscious input. Surrealist games are especially good for this.

See also simple arts and crafts. If i just can't get the creative juices flowing I like to take a break by making some Kandi bracelets. (no disrespect to kandi artists! it can be a very complex art. I like to keep mine very simple.)

If you are more musically minded, this could be something like just making some sound on your instrument of choice, or a new instrument. Just getting the notes out. 

I find that once this creative process has been started, with my conscious mind free from getting too caught up in the details, it is often easy to keep it moving. Maybe I don't go all the way into a full piece of art, but I'm moving. And next time, I'll be able to push that boulder further.

I like to use the analogy of a runner training themselves at a high altitude where the air is thinner. In this struggle they can't push themselves as far as lower down, but the thin air forces their lungs to breathe harder, making them stronger. Then, when they are back at a normal air level, they can get more oxygen in them, and run better for it.

Sometimes, pushing yourself too far like this can work. Pushing through the pain knowing that you'll be able to handle it even better when its not painful. But it is a very very delicate balance, and it is very very easy to overdo it and burn yourself out. We all know burnout. 

Instead, you must think of the circuit runner who deliberately paces themself for most of the race - staying consistently behind their opponents, conserving their energy. Then in the final stretch when their opponents are tired they rush ahead, winning easily.

You must balance these two practices. 

When you are pacing yourself, deliberately only using a small portion of your energy, you allow yourself to take a step back and observe your own behaviours: learning your subconscious' strengths and weaknesses, building up energy in your reserves.

Then, when it is needed, you can rush ahead, pushing yourself as far as you can go. And through that struggle, your next task will be even easier.

The boulder is rolling slowly but its inertia carries it forward. And, much like it felt impossible to start it moving, it is even harder to stop.
